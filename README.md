# drivetimes
a script for calling OSRM to get driving times between a set of sources and destinations

Use:  Coordinates go in coords in Lat,Long format.  (Note that OSRM uses Long,Lat instead; coordinates are switched during processing.)
The top line is for sources, and the other lines are all destinations.
